This reposatory also contains the code for the previous experiments.

Created components for creating a new poll, display and vote on polls, and displaying the users.
Since i dont have a loggin session, every request is made by a hardcoded test user. 
The polls are displayed with the question and vote options. Each vote option have a vote button 
after, that creates a vote. It displays an alert if the voting is successfull, but does not display it another way. Since creating a poll and voting takes a user, is it also necessary to initially create a user. I used Bruno to do this. 

Did not manage to display the vote count on each option. Would change how the votes are stored to make the vote count easier to display. Could also add some css to make the page look better. Only the user components are currently set to auto update.
